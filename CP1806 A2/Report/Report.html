  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the analysis of the test run, we have got constructive comments which really help us to fix the errors and add the things we needed. After that, we have changed and added some of the things in the website. Since add to cart feature is not working, we fixed this error by making the online order form page and linked. We also added how to order page to give the user information about the ordering and services. We added the borders to the images at the home page. We changed the background image and some colors in our website in order to be more user friendly for the targeted audience. We put the e-mail form to fill up in the feedback form. We have also made some alignments of the contents. We fixed the alignment error of the footer in the homepage. We added the FRIAS logo in the header section of each page. We increased the text size in the slide shows at the home page. We also fixed the location in the map to Singapore. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we started working, our leader made plan and discussed about the process of developing the website in order to finish in time. During the process, our group had many meetings and we cooperated each other and assigned works such as testing, error checking and writing codes and report to develop the website faster. We also worked through the Git-Hub when we are at home or when we could not have meeting. We discussed and share our ideas for the website. We had found out the errors and found the solutions in many ways through online, by asking the senior students and by asking to the lecturer. We found the images which are suitable for the website and we also had to write the data for each of the contents in each of the web pages. Moreover, we had to decide the font and the color of the web pages to match the target audience. After passing over every difficulties, our group could finally finished the website. We helped each other during the process and we are really happy to work as a team for this project. This group project really helped us to improve our learning style and time management as a group.</span> </blockquote>
